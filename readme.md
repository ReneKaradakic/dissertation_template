# Dissertation Template

I have put together a very basic template which can be used to combine multiple papers into a final dissertation document. The structure of the template is simple. It should compile using pdflatex. I am sure if you have worked with latex before you are going to make it work. An example how my final thesis looked can be downloaded [here](https://openaccess.nhh.no/nhh-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/3069516/_%2018_00704-19%20disseration_karadakic%20733292_2_1.PDF?sequence=1&isAllowed=y). 

### dissertation_template_main.tex
Main document which sets the structure and layout of the final dissertation document. Here you can also add chapter titles, footnotes, abstracts for your chapters. The content of the chapters is located in different tex-files. 

### chapters
In the chapters folder you can add the relevant chapter tex-files for your thesis. If you have written your thesis in latex before you can add the papers here and alter the code such that it integrates with the main file. 

### figures
Simply where I put all the figures for the different chapters to keep it organized

### tables 
Simply where I put all the tables for the different chatpers to keep it organized
